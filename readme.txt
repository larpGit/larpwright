## Description
The Larpwright Design Tools plugin provides four custom post types and related custom taxonomies that may help with designing and planning a [larp](https://nordiclarp.org/wiki/Larp) (live-action role-play):
* Character
* Scene
* Location
* Prop

The focus is on collaboration allowing a team to jointly write characters and plots, comment on each otherâ€™s work, and track changes across revisions. The plugin depends on a couple of other plugins to provide its full potential, e.g., for linking connections between characters or adding logos or banners to custom taxonomies like in-game groups.

Please see the demo on [Larpwright Online](https://www.larpwright.online).
